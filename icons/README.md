# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon for the toolbar
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixel icon for the extensions page
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixel icon for the Chrome Web Store

## Icon Design Guidelines

The icons should feature:
- A modern, minimalistic design
- A floating window or chat bubble concept
- Colors that represent AI/technology (blues, purples, gradients)
- Clear visibility at all sizes
- Consistent branding across all sizes

## Temporary Solution

For development/testing purposes, you can:
1. Use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files as placeholders
2. Create simple colored squares or use existing icons
3. Generate icons using online tools or AI image generators

The extension will work without these icons, but Chrome may show default placeholder icons.
