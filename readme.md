# FloatingChat - AI Platform Enhancer

A Chrome extension that enhances usability on AI chat platforms by providing floating answer windows that display the latest AI responses independently of the main chat interface.

## Features

- **Automatic Platform Detection**: Automatically detects and works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek
- **Floating Answer Window**: Shows the latest AI response in a resizable, draggable floating window
- **Independent Scrolling**: Read long answers without affecting your main chat position
- **Response Pinning & Navigation**: Pin any response to read while asking new questions
- **Multi-Response History**: Navigate through all conversation responses with controls
- **Elegant Design**: Apple-inspired UI with light/dark mode support
- **Seamless Integration**: Works without interfering with normal platform operation
- **Persistent Settings**: Remembers window position, size, and preferences

## Supported Platforms

- **ChatGPT** (chatgpt.com) - Enhanced with scroll prevention
- **Claude** (claude.ai) 
- **Gemini** (gemini.google.com)
- **DeepSeek** (chat.deepseek.com)

## Enhanced Features

### Response Pinning & Navigation
This powerful feature allows you to multitask effectively:

**Pin Responses**: 
- Click the ðŸ“Œ pin button to "freeze" the current response in the floating window
- Continue reading long responses while asking new questions
- Pinned responses won't be replaced by new ones

**Navigate Response History**:
- Use â—€ â–¶ buttons to browse through all conversation responses
- See response counter (e.g., "3/7") showing current position
- Jump to any previous response instantly

**Auto-Update Mode** (default):
- Shows the latest response automatically
- Unpin to resume following the latest responses

### How It Works
1. **Response Storage**: Every AI response is automatically stored for navigation
2. **Independent Display**: Floating window operates independently from main chat scrolling
3. **Smart Multitasking**: Read long responses while continuing the conversation
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators show pinned state and navigation position

### Use Cases
- **Long Code Explanations**: Pin a code example while asking follow-up questions
- **Research Sessions**: Reference previous answers while exploring new topics  
- **Complex Tutorials**: Keep instructions visible while asking for clarification
- **Comparison Tasks**: Compare multiple responses side-by-side mentally

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Manifest V3**: Uses the latest Chrome extension manifest version
- **Content Scripts**: Injected into supported AI platforms for DOM monitoring
- **Service Worker**: Handles background tasks and extension lifecycle
- **Storage API**: Persists user settings across sessions

### Platform Detection

The extension detects platforms by examining:
- Current URL hostname
- DOM structure patterns
- Platform-specific selectors

### Answer Monitoring

- Uses `MutationObserver` to detect new AI responses
- Fallback polling every 5 seconds for missed changes
- Multiple selector patterns for robustness across platform updates

### Floating Window Features

- **Draggable**: Click header to drag window anywhere on screen
- **Resizable**: Drag corner handle to adjust size
- **Minimizable**: Collapse to header-only view
- **Responsive**: Adapts to screen size and platform themes
- **Persistence**: Remembers position and size between sessions

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Version 88+ (Manifest V3 support required)
- **Edge**: Version 88+ (Chromium-based)
- **Other Chromium browsers**: Should work with Manifest V3 support

## Privacy & Permissions

The extension requires minimal permissions:

- **activeTab**: Access to current tab for platform detection
- **storage**: Save user preferences
- **host_permissions**: Access to supported AI platforms only

**No data collection**: The extension operates entirely locally and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or conversation content.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Extension not working on supported site**:
   - Refresh the page
   - Check that the extension is enabled
   - Verify you're on a supported platform URL

2. **Floating window not appearing**:
   - Ensure the extension is toggled on in the popup
   - Start a new conversation to trigger AI response
   - Check browser console for error messages

3. **Window position lost**:
   - Use the "Reset Position" button in the popup
   - The window may be positioned off-screen

4. **Performance issues**:
   - The extension uses minimal resources
   - Try refreshing the page if performance degrades

### Advanced Debugging

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for FloatingChat messages
3. Examine the extension popup for status information
4. Use `chrome://extensions/` to reload the extension if needed
